# eight_queen_problem_genetic_algo
A basic different approach to eight queen problem's solution using genetic algorithm

Instead of searching an unspecific location of queens, a fixed size array containing location of queens has used and genetic algorithm
was trying to achieve this array by changing random created arrays.<br />
Used Order-1-Crossover <br />
Used Tournament Selection <br />
Used Mutation <br />
